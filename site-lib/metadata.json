The crate is large, heavy and sealed with both magic and technology proprietary to the client, the Zeltek Commission. The contract calls for delivery to Supervisor Granok personally with bioscan signature. You’ve been given a navpath and your ship has been fully refueled. Reward has been promised on delivery.\nmechanical walkthrough of shipsRead the following aloud to your players:\nAfter a lengthy journey, your ship finally emerges back into normal space in the Obsidish system just outside the extensive planetary rings of Obsidish-2. Far away but still in visual range of the Wandervoid is what is locally known as the Pommit Core, Obsidish-2's only moon and the primary source of material keeping the planet's rings thick and sprawling. The Pommit Core looks like a partially eaten apple core, the result of years of mining as well as a cataclysmic battle involving a now-slumbering god. Starquarry Station Gork is interior to Obsidish-2's rings. You begin to navigate through the rocky debris fields towards your destination.\nAsk the pilot a question like:\nYou’ve noticed something unique about the rocky debris of the rings. What is it?\nDescribe the asteroids and particulates the ship passes, specifically including details from their answer. Consider emphasizing not just visual elements of the fields but also the sounds small rocks make as they bounce off hull and ship shields. This is utilizing one of the GM Principles in Daggerheart, “Ask Questions and Incorporate the Answers,” as well as a general storytelling principle of utilizing multiple sense descriptors. Then, read the following aloud:\nAs your ship, the Wandervoid, weaves past a large asteroid, a ping pops up on the scanners and you see another another ship floating among the stony clutter before you. It appears to be unpowered save for the apparent SOS identifying it as a Zeltek Commission ship and requesting urgent assistance. Hull metal curls at the edge of a large rend along the longitudinal axis of the ship as if it collided with a large object while in motion. If the ship depressurized, survivors could still have made their way to an emergency cabin and sealed the bulkheads to await rescue. If there are no survivors, there certainly could be good salvage on the ship. Either way, Captain &lt;&gt; is well aware that Zeltek Commission contracts include incidental rescue obligations for any and all other Zeltek Commission ships you encounter under your contract. From within, the rest of you feel the ship decelerate to a stop. What would you like to do?\nAllow the PCs to roleplay for a little bit if they’d like. When somebody approaches the merchant cart, that will trigger the first action roll.Read the following aloud:\nThe strixwolf is wary of your movement. Let’s make our first roll to see how she reacts! This will be using your Presence trait, so grab your Duality Dice and roll them, then add your Presence. You can also spend a Hope before the roll to add an Experience, if it applies. Then tell me the total and which die rolled higher!\nIf they rolled a 10 or higher, it is a success! Describe the strixwolf calmly trying to keep her pups out of danger.\nIf the roll was with Hope, tell the player to gain a Hope.\nIf the roll was with Fear, gain a Fear. This is also your chance to introduce a consequence to the scene. It should not undermine the success, but rather forward the narrative in an exciting way. You might say:\nThe mother hoot-howls, as if calling to another strixwolf among the trees. You know you might not be alone for long.\nIf they rolled a 9 or below, it is a failure. Describe the strixwolf snarling and snapping, angry that the PC is approaching.\nIf the roll was with Hope, tell the player to gain a Hope. You still get to make a GM move, but because it’s with Hope, it shouldn’t be as bad as it could be. You might say:\nWith one last snarl, she leans down to have her pups clamber onto her back before taking off into the air, landing on a nearby branch. She is watching your every move.\nIf the roll was with Fear, things go badly. Gain a Fear and describe the strixwolf snarling at the PC, causing them to mark a Stress.If both dice roll the same number, it’s a critical success! Tell the PC to mark a Hope. They can also clear a Stress, if they have one. Then, describe the strixwolf moving towards the PC, head down, tail wagging. It sits in front of them.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"The Beginning","level":2,"id":"The_Beginning_0"},{"heading":"The First Ship Module Action Roll","level":2,"id":"The_First_Ship_Module_Action_Roll_0"},{"heading":"SUCCESS","level":3,"id":"SUCCESS_0"},{"heading":"FAILURE","level":3,"id":"FAILURE_0"},{"heading":"CRITICAL SUCCESS","level":3,"id":"CRITICAL_SUCCESS_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"games/daggerheart/starquarry-couriers-quickstart/act-i.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754519309125,"modifiedTime":1754597461447,"sourceSize":4811,"sourcePath":"Games/Daggerheart/Starquarry Couriers Quickstart/Act I.md","exportPath":"games/daggerheart/starquarry-couriers-quickstart/act-i.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":3,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"games/daggerheart/starquarry-couriers-quickstart/act-ii.html":{"title":"Act II","icon":"","description":"Let the events of the previous act play out, allowing the players to roleplay and take other actions.

I’m going to set up a map!\nRead the following aloud:\nIn a whirlwind of cracking branches and unsheathed blades, a group of four Thistlefolk jump out from the brush alongside the road. The overturned cart was an ambush! They stand before you, weapons drawn, blocking the road. They'll go first. I’m going to set up a battle map!\nTake the forest terrain you’ve cut out and ask for your players to help you spread it across the table to build a map. You may also encourage them to grab other items from around the room to add terrain to the map. Build out the playspace together.Then, place the overturned merchant’s cart on the table and ask the players to put their miniatures nearby, where they think they would be in the scene, along with their carriage. Finally, take the Thistlefolk Ambusher standees and the Thistlefolk Thief, and put them in Close range of the PCs.On the next page, you’ll find the stat blocks for the Ambushers and Thief. You’ll use those stat blocks to run the remainder of this encounter. Remember to make the battle your own. Decide what the Thistlefolk look like in detail, describe the scene as if the players were watching a movie or reading a book, and if you’re comfortable with it, ask them to participate in building out the scene as well. This can be as easy as asking them to describe their attack or their evasion in detail, but you might also involve them further—ask them what unique clothing item the Ambushers are all wearing, or the interesting fighting style they seem to employ. You might also ask what level of violence the players are comfortable with. Are they looking to kill the enemies? Incapacitate them? Knock them out?If the players were ambushed, the Thistlefolk act first. We can see this reflected in their feature, “Ambush.” Read the following aloud:\nHaving the upper hand, the three Thistlefolk Ambushers rush you! Because of their Ambush feature, they get to make an attack immediately. This only happens when they enter the scene, so it won’t be like this every time. But right now, they are slashing at you with daggers, protected by armor made of polished stones.\nMove the ambushers into melee with the PC closest to them. Then follow the attack guide below for each Ambusher.If the players spotted the Ambushers coming, they get to act first.

Instead of repeating all of the information three times, it is in one centralized area.When you make an attack against a PC, roll a d20 and add its attack modifier (+1), then compare it to the PC’s Evasion. If it hits, make a damage roll using 1d8+5.

This denotes one corner of the peaceful village of Hush. When you pass beyond the stone marker, you feel a small sensation like the pop of a bubble, then the sounds of friendly chatter become louder.\nThough the trees of the Sablewood are unchanged here, there is a distinctive safe and comforting air. A few smiling faces turn to you as your carriage rolls in, waving or casting a warm greeting toward the party. There is lively music drifting your direction from the tavern at the center of town.\nYou know you need to find the Whitefire Arcanist to deliver the package from the King. What would you like to do?\nIf the players would like to talk to an NPC, you can choose one of the options below.Wildborne&nbsp;Human&nbsp;- (they/them)A young child who will not stop wiggling—it’s clear how they earned their name. They are often busy scurrying up the trees in town, lighting the lanterns that hang from the branches. They know the fastest ways through the village. If the PCs approach, they are curious what life is like outside of Hush.Dwarf&nbsp;- (she/her)An older woman with a thick beard carrying a barrel of ale. She is happy to stand and talk to the party (she will keep the barrel on her shoulder the entire time). If the PCs approach, she wants to know the name of every member of the party’s weapons and the date they were forged.Loreborne&nbsp;Clank&nbsp;- (he/him)A soft-spoken clank (a humanoid robot) of indeterminate age. He bears a number of small scratches across his metallic shoulder where an alert but friendly fox-bat rests. He is playing an unknown game that uses cards and acorns. If the PCs approach, he is curious about the Thistlefolk and asks if you encountered any on your way.During their discussion, choose an additional NPC from the list above. The second will be a friend that has knowledge of where the Whitefire Arcanist lives. They last saw this person at the tavern and send you in its direction.For example, your PCs might meet Fidget in town. After some conversation and coaxing, Fidget points the party to the tavern to meet Lausa.Read the following aloud:\nThe Clover Tavern is a sight to behold, with six curving stories climbing the trunk of an ancient tree. This is the heart of the community, always crowded with music and good-natured conversation. Newcomers to the bar must take off their shoes and hang them over a line that stretches across the bar’s ground floor. Inevitably, by the time visitors leave, their shoes will be shined and filled with small trinkets. As you enter, what would you like to do?\nLet the players roleplay here for a bit, introduce them to a barkeep or a friendly local who asks them to hang their shoes on the line. Let them explore the different levels of the tavern, and if you feel comfortable, ask some of your players to participate in describing details about it.\nHow does the second floor of this tavern look so wildly different than the first? What smell permeates the air throughout this place? What unique custom do the locals seem to participate in every time you walk in the room? If they ask around, the PCs will find out the people of Hush are currently celebrating the Firstmoss Festival—the time when the new crops in the Sunless Farms have the first layer of moss growing upon them, meaning they’re beginning to ripen for the season. It’s a celebration of the arrival of spring, and of the abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables the town will soon have. There is a good-natured arm wrestling competition, a stone-painting class, and a small marketplace full of homemade trinkets.\nWhen you’re ready, guide the players in finding an NPC who will help them. If they bypassed asking someone in town, just use one of the NPCs from the list here instead. After a few exchanges, you can have the NPC say something like:\nThe Arcanist is quite busy, but if you’ve traveled so far, I’m sure she’ll be more than hospitable. We would be lost without her. She keeps this whole place protected by a powerful ward so that no dangers from the Sablewood can pass into town. You’ll find her house to the south, through the farmland. It’s hanging from one of the old Sablewood trees, you can’t miss it.\nWhen the PCs are ready, set them off towards the Arcanist.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Arrival in Hush","level":2,"id":"Arrival_in_Hush_0"},{"heading":"Fidget -","level":5,"id":"Fidget_-_0"},{"heading":"Lausa Standworth - Wildborne","level":5,"id":"Lausa_Standworth_-_Wildborne_0"},{"heading":"Halython Fives -","level":5,"id":"Halython_Fives_-_0"},{"heading":"The Clover Tavern","level":2,"id":"The_Clover_Tavern_0"},{"heading":"<strong><em>Optional</em></strong>&nbsp;- The Firstmoss Festival","level":5,"id":"**_Optional_** -_The_Firstmoss_Festival_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"games/daggerheart/starquarry-couriers-quickstart/act-iii.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754519325849,"modifiedTime":1754527974478,"sourceSize":4656,"sourcePath":"Games/Daggerheart/Starquarry Couriers Quickstart/Act III.md","exportPath":"games/daggerheart/starquarry-couriers-quickstart/act-iii.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":5,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"games/daggerheart/starquarry-couriers-quickstart/act-iv.html":{"title":"Act IV","icon":"","description":"Read the following aloud:\nMaking your way past the homes of the village, then through the farmlands of Hush, you see a variety of crops that have begun to cultivate a thin layer of glowing blue moss over the top of their fruits and vegetables. They pulse softly like a heartbeat as you pass.\nAmong the thriving groves, you notice that the Sablewood trees in this area have hundreds of unique faces carved into all sides, the eyes peering in every direction.\nOne tree, taller than the rest, bears the Arcanist’s home, like an overripe fruit. It hangs from a braid of rope, as wide around as a giant’s forearm, tied to a massive branch and counterweighted by a cabin-sized bolder lying at the base of the tree. The stone is marked with a collection of symbols and the cabin windows flash with a soft, yellow-green light.\nWhat would you all like to do?\n<img src=\"https://app.demiplane.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.demiplane.com%2Fcompendium%2Fdaggerheart%2Fquick-start-adventure%2FZehH1VoTzWsB4ERe%2F00-16-Quickstart-pg33.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=90\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">Give the players the option to roleplay and problem solve.

Though her expressions are difficult to read, her emotions are very clear in her voice. She is old but spry, and she eyes the group mischieviously.\n“Are you the group Emeris sent from the capital? Oh my, you’re rather late aren’t you. Come in, come in.”\nAs the Arcanist lowers her home and invites you inside, you’ll notice the treehouse is surprisingly spacious. The main room is a crowd of potion bottles, spellbooks, runes, plants, and small creatures of all kinds. But, no one could classify this place as messy. It’s clear that if anyone moved a single item even an inch, the old faerie would notice.\n<br><img src=\"https://app.demiplane.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.demiplane.com%2Fcompendium%2Fdaggerheart%2Fquick-start-adventure%2FZehH1VoTzWsB4ERe%2F00-29-Chara-Archanist.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=90\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">Let the players roleplay with the Arcanist.

In order to inspect it in safety, she will magically unfold her home as if it were a blossoming flower. She’ll hurry the players to get the crate inside before closing the cabin back up, now just a bit bigger. When she opens the delivery, read the section below aloud:\nInside King Emeris’ package lies a massive stone with a lion’s face carved into it. Marlowe, you recognize this as the keystone of the capital city gate’s main archway. The Arcanist nods sagely as soon as she sees it, saying: “Of course the King would keep this delivery secret. If anyone knew your city was no longer warded, you would be conquered before sunrise.” With this ominous warning, she starts to unfurl her treehouse yet again. “We must travel to the Open Vale to revitalize the ward. But such an effort of magic will attract dangerous creatures from the darkest reaches of the Sablewood. I’ll need your help.”\nIf the players seem enthusiastic about helping, you should cut straight to the Open Vale, transitioning into Act Five.

Engage the PCs in conversation, then when you’re ready, read the following:\nThe Arcanist’s antennae perk up in a disconcerting way. “This is good. Stop, stop. Yes, here. Now come help me, I’m old.” This time, she unfolds the carriage as she did with her home and stands over the crate, humming. Her body starts to glow brighter, flickering in the night.\n“I will need an hour of time to prepare. You all, enjoy the night air while you can. We’ll be very busy soon.”\nTell the PCs that they will now take a short rest.During a short rest, a PC may choose up to two of the following options.&nbsp;They may choose the same option twice.Describe how you patch yourself up and clear 1d4+1&nbsp;hit points. You may also tend to an ally instead.Describe how you blow off steam or pull yourself together, and clear 1d4+1&nbsp;Stress.Describe how you spend time quickly repairing your armor and clear 1d4+1 marked&nbsp;Armor Slots. You may also repair an ally’s armor instead.Describe how you prepare yourself for the path ahead and gain a&nbsp;Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one or more members of your party, you may each take two Hope.While the PCs are resting, take 1d4&nbsp;Fear&nbsp;as your&nbsp;downtime&nbsp;benefit, then review the stat blocks for adversaries located below and on the next page. These will be used in the final battle.<img src=\"https://app.demiplane.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.demiplane.com%2Fcompendium%2Fdaggerheart%2Fquick-start-adventure%2FZehH1VoTzWsB4ERe%2F00-27-Quickstart-Standee-Skeleton.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=90\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">Tier 1 StandardDifficulty:&nbsp;12 |&nbsp;Thresholds:&nbsp;7/none |&nbsp;HP:&nbsp;2 |&nbsp;Stress:&nbsp;1ATK:&nbsp;+0 |&nbsp;Rusted Sword:&nbsp;Melee | 1d6+1 phyGroup Attack - Action:*&nbsp;Spend a Fear&nbsp;to choose a target and spotlight all Ancient Skeletons within&nbsp;Close&nbsp;range of them. Those creatures move into&nbsp;Melee&nbsp;range of the target and make one shared&nbsp;attack roll. On a success, they deal 4&nbsp;physical damage&nbsp;each. Combine this damage.ANCIENT SKELETON BATTLE GUIDEBecause the skeletons have no attack modifier, roll a d20 and ask if it hits the target’s&nbsp;Evasion. On a success, deal 1d6+1&nbsp;physical damage.If the ancient skeletons take 6 or less damage, they mark one&nbsp;hit point. Otherwise, they are defeated.Their&nbsp;Group Attack&nbsp;Feature allows you to activate several skeletons at once to make a powerful attack. When you use this action as your&nbsp;GM move, you must spend a&nbsp;Fear&nbsp;to activate the group attack, then move all skeletons in&nbsp;close&nbsp;range of a target into melee with them. Make one attack roll with a +0 modifier against the PC's Evasion. On a success, deal 4&nbsp;phy damage&nbsp;per skeleton. Add all of this damage up before dealing it to the PC.Act Five // Part TwoRead the following aloud:\nThe Arcanist lets out a shrill cry, “The keystone has finally responded! Quickly, surround me, the ritual must begin or I’ll lose the pathway! Hurry!” Her body begins glowing brighter and brighter still as her eyes roll backwards into her head and the entire carriage lifts a foot off the ground. A collection of unearthly screeches echo from the woods as nearby creatures are alerted to the arcane energy.\nThen place the Whitefire Arcanist standee at the center of the table. Ask the players to also place their standees in the scene. Finally, place four&nbsp;Ancient Skeletons&nbsp;within&nbsp;close&nbsp;range of the Arcanist and two&nbsp;Forest Wraiths&nbsp;within&nbsp;far&nbsp;range, then read the following aloud.\nYou feel a rumble as four ancient skeletons emerge from the ground, rusted swords in hand, disturbed by the forces of magic being used by the Arcanist. In the distance, two Forest Wraiths float ominously towards you. I’m going to start a&nbsp;countdown die&nbsp;for the ritual, your goal is to hold off the enemies until her work is completed.\nGrab a d8 and set it on the table with the 8 facing up. This is a countdown die. It will tick down one number every time an adversary is defeated. It will tick up every time the Whitefire Arcanist is hit with an attack. When the countdown reaches 0, the ritual is complete and the fight will end.Environments can have their own features that let you utilize them in a unique way. For this encounter, you have an environment feature called Vengeance of the Vale.Tier 1 ExplorationVengeance of the Vale - Action:&nbsp;Spend a&nbsp;Fear&nbsp;to summon two additional&nbsp;ancient skeletons&nbsp;from the ground within&nbsp;very close&nbsp;range of a PC.The countdown progresses every time an adversary is defeated, so if it's not moving quickly enough, use&nbsp;Vengeance of the Vale&nbsp;to spawn more skeletons, as they're easy to take down. Have adversaries target the Whitefire Arcanist if no other PCs are within attack range. Her difficulty is 11. She doesn't mark&nbsp;Hit Points&nbsp;or&nbsp;Stress, any damage done to her should be purely narrative.Forest Wraiths can attack from&nbsp;far&nbsp;range with a +3 attack modifier. On a success, they deal 2d6+8&nbsp;\nmagic damage. They have&nbsp;resistance&nbsp;to&nbsp;physical damage, meaning any incoming physical damage is cut in half (rounded up).Their&nbsp;Memory Delve&nbsp;move makes the target&nbsp;Vulnerable, which means all rolls you make against them are at advantage (roll an additional d20 and take the highest result). This condition doesn’t stack.Pass-Through&nbsp;should be used sparingly to avoid incapacitating the whole party at once. Because this move knocks a PC out of their body and stops them from acting until an adversary is taken down, using the&nbsp;Vengeance of the Vale&nbsp;Encounter Move can be a useful way to generate new, easily defeatable adversaries to avoid this from happening.<br><img src=\"https://app.demiplane.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.demiplane.com%2Fcompendium%2Fdaggerheart%2Fquick-start-adventure%2FZehH1VoTzWsB4ERe%2F00-28-Quickstart-Standee-Wraith.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=90\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">Tier 1 BruisersDifficulty:&nbsp;13 |&nbsp;Thresholds:&nbsp;7/14 |&nbsp;HP:&nbsp;6 |&nbsp;Stress:&nbsp;3ATK:&nbsp;+3 |&nbsp;Lifedrain:&nbsp;Far | 2d6+8 magSpectral Body - Passive:&nbsp;The Forest Wraith has&nbsp;resistance&nbsp;to&nbsp;physical damage.Memory Delve - Action:&nbsp;Make an&nbsp;attack roll&nbsp;against a close target.

The carriage comes falling to the ground as the keystone vibrates with arcane energy. Then, all at once, a soundless explosion erupts from the Whitefire Arcanist, dissipating any last enemies who might remain. The clearing is quiet once again.\nBack inside the treehouse, not but an hour later, the keystone sits suspended carefully above a rumbling fire in the hearth.\nThe Arcanist, who looks even older now than she did before, sits cross-legged in an over-stuffed chair. There is an exhaustion in her voice as she speaks.\n“You fought hard. I’m not surprised, of course. The King keeps good company. I’m very glad you were there.”\nGive the PCs the chance to wrap up their story with the Arcanist. When conversation stalls or the PCs ask about the keystone, you might say something like:\n“The keystone will need a week, maybe more, to allow the magic to settle. I’ll need to watch it carefully to ensure nothing cracks or becomes sentient or anything of the like. You know how it is. And in the meantime, after you rest and gather yourselves, have a nice hot meal and warm bath, I have one more thing to ask of you.”\nWe pull out of the Arcanist’s home, out of the forest itself, to view the verdant expanse from above, and see twisting stone spires breaking through the treeline, each with a flame flickering within the tower like a beacon. She continues:\n“There’s a Spire, just west of here, maybe a few hours walk. I felt it on the way to the ritual. Its power was... strange. The light felt weaker than it should be. I think something might be terribly wrong with the Spirekeeper, and I fear what will happen if its fire is extinguished altogether. When you’re ready, come back, and I’ll give you my map so you can make it there safely. It’s good to have heroes in the Sablewood again.”\nAnd that’s where we’re going to end today’s session.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"The Keystone Ward","level":2,"id":"The_Keystone_Ward_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"games/daggerheart/starquarry-couriers-quickstart/epilogue.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754528650273,"modifiedTime":1754528691562,"sourceSize":2019,"sourcePath":"Games/Daggerheart/Starquarry Couriers Quickstart/Epilogue.md","exportPath":"games/daggerheart/starquarry-couriers-quickstart/epilogue.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":8,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"games/daggerheart/starquarry-courriers-ritual-location.html":{"title":"Starquarry Courriers Ritual Location","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"games/daggerheart/starquarry-courriers-ritual-location.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754245254357,"modifiedTime":1754245254357,"sourceSize":0,"sourcePath":"Games/Daggerheart/Starquarry Courriers Ritual Location.md","exportPath":"games/daggerheart/starquarry-courriers-ritual-location.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":9,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"novels/snibs'-story/index.html":{"title":"Index","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"novels/snibs'-story/index.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1741495114407,"modifiedTime":1741495114499,"sourceSize":135,"sourcePath":"Novels/Snibs' Story/Index.md","exportPath":"novels/snibs'-story/index.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":12,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"novels/high-level-notes.html":{"title":"High Level Notes","icon":"","description":"\nEarthsea/Tolkien tone\nLost love interest is Romali, Queen of Exiles, an ascended Firbolg god that keeps a massive living space station planetoid as her domain, with which she has merged to some degree\nSnibs was godsbound by the Mad God Yudwichinda (an exiled Elven god?), who has become infatuated with the Queen of Exiles when they first encountered her;

Elves are even more varied than humans, their physical form tending to take on visual characteristics based on the environment in which they’re born. As a result, Elven parents of one type may have children of an altogether different type or even types. All Elves, regardless of variety, have long pointy ears that tend to droop down at the tip (and are consistently primary focuses of decoration across nearly all Elven cultures). Elven eyes are of a uniform color and do not display a differentiated pupil and iris like the majority of other common hominids.There are four standard groupings of Elves (though there may be more as a result of Elves residing in unusual places), consisting of: Bone Elves, Rind Elves, Void Elves, and Green Elves. Rind Elves and Bone Elves are the most common and dominate their artificial homeworld of Aelfweld, which is a Dyson sphere ecumenopolis. Rind Elves live on the exterior surface of Aelfweld, which is provided a diurnal cycle by a system of artificial miniature stars set into orbit around Aelfweld, and are a grey hued people sometimes taking on very light pastel tints. Bone Elves reside within the internal structure of Aelfweld and even the interior surface that faces its encased star. Bone Elves are dark hued, typically very dark shades of reds and oranges, though deep greens and blues are not unusual. Void Elves and Green Elves arise from those Elven lineages that migrated off of Aelfweld. Green Elves are not necessarily green, although this is by far the most common tone, but they can be found in natural environments and worlds. Green Elves have a deep pastel hued complexion, usually greens or blues and sometimes even various shades of red, purple, or pink. Void Elves make their homes in space, either as nomadic colonies of roving ships or settled into some sort of asteroid, space station, or other stable non-planetary structure relatively detached from a single star. Void Elves have a jet black complexion that, under bright broad spectrum light, may display a gentle rainbow sheen like an oil slick.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"setting/species/elf.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754266870921,"modifiedTime":1754301845074,"sourceSize":2262,"sourcePath":"Setting/Species/Elf.md","exportPath":"setting/species/elf.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":29,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"setting/species/ethereal.html":{"title":"Ethereal","icon":"","description":"Energy

Cosm, which is the common name for the “galaxy,” of Cosmic Leap is actually two galaxies oriented orthogonal to each other and collided nearly halfway somewhat like in the image below. However, this is occurring at a cosmic pace so it is totally unfelt by most mortal species. It has also been happening for so long that for the majority of inhabitants, this has always been the galaxy’s (galaxies’) structure—although some incredibly long-lived entities, like certain gods, may have memory of their respective galaxy pre-collision. While most wouldn’t realize it, technically one galaxy is home to the “standard” high fantasy species and cultures, like elves, humans, dwarves, gnomes, halflings, etc. The other is where the more “alien” species long ago developed. Nevertheless, at the “current” point in time, all species are so thoroughly distributed across the Cosm that none would recognize any other as particularly alien to the Cosm. Though, of course, many planets favor a particular species and may even be homeworlds to that species, like the elves of Aelfweld for example.Magic suffuses the Cosm and while not universally used or accessible, is effectively known by everyone and a very common sight. The Cosm, and it is theorized this entire universe, is really a quivering membrane of mana stretched across six elemental dimensions. Practicing magic is a matter of a kind of “plucking” or “beating” of the membrane so that its vibrations resonate along these various elemental axes in different ways, thus invoking various effects in the Cosm (and potentially in any affected planes as well). The Cosm is not distributed evenly across the elemental axes, though, and some parts of the Cosm may be strong in some planes and utterly void in others. Some may even be a confluence of all the dimensions at once and others none at all! The six Meta Axes, as they are referred to by academics, are: Life, Reason, Temperature, Matter, Energy, Time.It is important to understand that the Meta Axes are not planes, though the membrane constituting the Cosm may be considered a plane, and the Meta Axes are, as far as anyone knows, not directly accessible as any sort of space in their own right. Rather, an unknown number of planes are able to extend across the Meta Axes and all are effectively orthogonal to each other just as much as the Meta Axes are to themselves. That is to say, there may be punctuated locations where travel between these membranes or planes is possible, but they never overlap. These other planes are where some theorize various afterlives are located. Some planes also may adhere very closely to one or another particular Meta Axis and so give the appearance of being a “Plane of Matter” or “Plane of Energy” but they are not, and other planes may be similarly closely hewn to the same Meta Axis. Moreover, travel between these planes is not recommended as there is never a guarantee that they abide by the same physics and metaphysics of the Cosm.As mentioned, there are all manner of entities of various degrees of power within the Cosm, including gods. The “gods” of the Cosm are beings of immense power, who vary in nature as much as they vary in how they achieved their powers (including simply being elemental expressions of the Cosm), but they are all mobile confluences of all Meta Axes. Every god effectively forces every Meta Axis to intersect upon their being, and thus can warp and weave the Cosm in unfathomable ways. The Cosm’s gods are myriad, but the Cosm’s span is also inconceivably immense—gods are powerful but space is BIG. As a result, mortals in the Cosm have simply learned to try to avoid unknown gods as much as they can. Given the vastness of the Cosm, even the most active and mobile gods are unlikely to ever descend upon more than a vanishingly small fraction of the Cosm’s inhabitants in any arbitrarily large span of time.When mortals are visited by a god, though, some are inevitably pulled into that god’s inscrutable plan and displaced randomly throughout the Cosm as a result once they serve their purpose to the god. This is typically referred to as a Cosmic Leap and those actively working under a god as godsbound (and those released from service are referred to as godsleapt). The gods share one more universal trait, and that is their ability to enthrall a mortal’s mind. When someone becomes godsbound, they are not merely forced to do what their god wants, but it simply seems completely logical and obvious to do so. The godsbound want to do what their god needs. Once they are godsleapt, their reasoning and feelings when godsbound may seem completely foreign, but it is universal that godsbound are not coerced to do their gods’ bidding—it’s just something they feel is obviously the correct thing to do at the time. It is unclear if this enthrallment is something gods do intentionally or is just a consequence of their mere presence. Those who believe the enthrallment is a sort of knotting of the Axial Harmony that makes up every living thing’s “soul” typically also ascribe to the theory that godsbinding is a natural consequence of gods’ warping of the Meta Axes around them.These provide general themes of the driving conflicts that exist within the Cosm.\nNon-godsbound vs godsbound\nAble to traverse interstellar vs limited regional governments Axial tears vs normal space\nNascent empire(s) vs independent systems or even planets Lost technology vs hidden threats\nInvention vs inviting harm into the Cosm Local cultures tend to be insular vs inadvertently welcoming a threat\nSafer to trust few or no one vs found family and/or culture\nIn addition to the Meta Axes of Magic, there are two primary ways inhabitants of the Cosm interact with magic. The first are those with innate ability due to some quirk of their Axial Harmony, often referred to simply as “innates.” There is perhaps some small degree of heritability associated with innates, but it must be fairly negligible as an innate may seemingly arise in any bloodline and the likelihood of an innate being born to innate parents is nowhere near a guarantee. Perhaps one in a hundred thousand is an innate and their gifts are almost immediately apparent upon birth, whether artificial or natural, with minimal variance across sapient species (though this rule of thumb does not seem to apply to non-sapients).The other way to wield magic is broadly referred to as “academic” use of magic. Whereas innates summon their application of magic from within and manage it largely by intuition, academic magic users treat it as a field of scholarly study and must learn from those who came before or by means of experimentation and observation. Academic magic is available to all and is by far the most common way to manipulate the mana underlaying all existence across the various Meta Axes that are accessible in an area. Different cultures approach academic magic differently—some consider it a field of maths, some call it the learning and true naming of things, some consider it the accumulation of engrams, and endless other variations on its practice—but all treat it as a scholarly and learned pursuit.The most critical practical difference between innate and academic magic is that innates can use their magic anywhere, regardless of the accessible Meta Axes of magic in their current location while, in contrast, academics are limited by the magic available around them. When in a null zone, most academics are incapable of even the simplest spell of they have not taken proper precautions, but a nearby innate may nevertheless fling summoned orbs of varying temperature, hasten time in a local area, or even exude magic possibly to the benefit of the nearby and otherwise powerless academic. In addition, generally speaking, innates are bound to one Meta Axis of magic or even a particular sort of expression of that Axis, though this is not a hard rule and every locale has legends of innates able to harness multiple Axes. There are even theories that postulate an innate who is able to harness all Axes necessarily ascends to godhood, though such an event has never been recorded or at least published.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Axes of Conflict","level":1,"id":"Axes_of_Conflict_0"},{"heading":"Independence vs
